# Description
SoundSync is a Node.js, Express, and React web application with Spotify API integration that connects users based on shared favorite artists and podcasts and aims to reducing feelings of loneliness during social distancing. Users first give the application authentication via Spotify to access their top twenty artists and saved shows. The algorithm stores this information in a MongoDB database and compares it with other entries. Finally, the application producees the name and contact information of another Spotify user who matches the user's musical and intellectual tastes!
